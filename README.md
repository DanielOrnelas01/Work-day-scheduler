# Work-day-scheduler

Based on the given Acceptance Criteria from the customer I was able to create a functional calendar that will allow the user to save important events to a daily planner so that they can manage their time effectively.

Features that were included based on the criteria given include being able to see the current day displayed at the top of the calendar, time blocks that run from 9AM to 5PM, with each time block dynamically showing whether each time block is in the past, present, or future. When the user clicks in to a time block they are able to enter a calendar event that they want to remember. By clicking the save button on the right of that time block they are able to save that event. If the user were to refresh, or close the page, upon reopening the application they will be presented with any events that they previously saved.
